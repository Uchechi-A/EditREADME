#Uchechi  - Data Analyst Journey

### About 
Hi, I'm Uchechi! I have an analytical and funtional testing background in Software Testing and Fraud prevention. Currently,  I am on track to adding data anylytics toolkits to my skills. I have developed a strong foundation in compliance and fraud prevention with passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
This is a repository to showcase skills and my journey, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
